CIRCLE OS SPECIFICATION
Chapter 01: Vision & Principles
================================================================================

Document: 01_vision.txt
Version: 1.0
Date: December 2025
Status: Foundation

================================================================================
1. THE CIRCLE PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

"We are all one family circle, without which our community circle cannot thrive."

Circle OS exists to protect the individual so they may freely participate in 
community. Privacy is not isolation — it is sovereignty. The power to choose 
what you share, with whom, and when.

A person with privacy can:
- Join a stokvel without the bank tracking their savings patterns
- Message family without advertisers profiling their relationships
- Seek medical information without insurers adjusting their premiums
- Explore ideas without algorithms boxing them into filter bubbles
- Participate in democracy without manipulation

A person without privacy is not free. They are a product.

Circle OS returns that freedom.

================================================================================
2. CORE PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

2.1 PRIVACY IS SOVEREIGNTY, NOT ISOLATION
-----------------------------------------
We protect individual privacy so people can CHOOSE to participate in community.
Circle OS never prevents sharing — it ensures sharing is intentional.

- You may share your location with family. Circle ensures only family sees it.
- You may post publicly. Circle ensures you know it's public.
- You may join any service. Circle shows you what that service takes in return.

The individual is sovereign. Communities are chosen, not imposed.


2.2 COEXIST, DON'T CONQUER
--------------------------
Circle OS dual boots alongside existing systems. We do not ask users to 
abandon what works. We offer an alternative and let them choose.

- Android remains intact — boot back anytime
- User data remains accessible — photos, music, documents
- Existing apps can run — under Circle's privacy rules
- No bootloader unlock required where possible
- OEM warranty preserved where possible

We respect what came before. We earn trust through coexistence.


2.3 WORK WITH WHAT YOU HAVE
---------------------------
Not everyone can buy new hardware. Circle OS runs on existing devices.
The reference port is Huawei P30 Lite — chosen because it is:

- Widely owned in target markets
- Technically challenging (locked bootloader, Huawei restrictions)
- Affordable on the secondary market
- Representative of real-world constraints

If Circle OS works on P30 Lite, it works anywhere.
Circle native hardware is the aspiration, not the requirement.


2.4 APPS ARE WELCOME, SNOOPING ISN'T
------------------------------------
Android applications run on Circle OS — not emulated, but native.
The ART runtime executes APKs. The difference is oversight.

Every app runs under Circle's Privacy Framework:
- Network access requires permission (revolutionary — Android doesn't do this)
- Storage access is scoped — apps see only what you share
- Contacts are scoped — share 3 contacts, not 300
- Background activity is visible and controllable
- All permission usage is logged and auditable

Apps that respect users are welcome.
Apps that refuse to run without snooping have made their choice.


2.5 GOOGLE IS A GUEST, NOT A LANDLORD
-------------------------------------
Google Play Services is not included by default.
Google applications are not pre-installed.

If Google wishes to participate:
- Their apps run in the same sandbox as everyone else
- Their services go through the same Privacy Framework
- Their tracking is visible in the same dashboards
- They receive no special privileges

If Google's services cannot function without surveillance, that is Google's 
problem to solve, not ours to accommodate.

Users who need Google services may install them — sandboxed, monitored, 
controlled. The choice is theirs.


2.6 SECURITY THROUGH HONESTY
----------------------------
We aspire to GrapheneOS-level security. We also acknowledge reality:

- Pixel phones have hardware security (Titan M) that P30 Lite lacks
- Circle native hardware will have designed-in security
- Ported devices have constraints we cannot fully overcome

We will be honest about security tiers:

TIER 1 - FULL SECURITY
  - Circle native hardware (designed for security)
  - Pixel devices (GrapheneOS-equivalent hardening)
  - Verified boot, hardware attestation, locked bootloader after install

TIER 2 - HARDENED SOFTWARE
  - Treble-compatible devices with unlockable bootloaders
  - Full software hardening, kernel hardening, sandboxing
  - No hardware root of trust — transparent about limitations

TIER 3 - BEST EFFORT
  - Devices requiring exploit-based boot (P30 Lite)
  - Maximum software protection within constraints
  - Clear documentation of what we cannot guarantee

A user on Tier 3 is still safer than stock Android with Google services.
But they deserve to know the difference.


2.7 ACCESSIBLE TO ALL
---------------------
"Ages 8 to 80" is not a slogan — it is a specification requirement.

- A child can use Circle OS safely (Kid Mode)
- An elder can use Circle OS comfortably (Elder Mode)
- A person with visual impairment can use Circle OS fully (Accessibility)
- A person in a rural area can use Circle OS offline (Offline-First)
- A person with a low-end device can use Circle OS smoothly (Performance)

If any of these fail, Circle OS has failed.


2.8 UBUNTU — I AM BECAUSE WE ARE
--------------------------------
Circle OS is built by a community, for communities.

The Circle Foundation governs with:
- Geographic diversity — no single country dominates
- Transparent funding — no single entity controls
- Open source code — anyone can verify, anyone can contribute
- Open hardware designs — anyone can manufacture

The technology belongs to humanity.
We are custodians, not owners.

================================================================================
3. WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
================================================================================

3.1 FOR THE INDIVIDUAL
----------------------
"I understand what my phone is doing."
"I control what apps can access."
"I trust my phone with my private life."
"I can still use the apps I need."
"I didn't have to buy a new phone."

3.2 FOR THE FAMILY
------------------
"My children are safe online."
"My parents can use their phone without confusion."
"We share what we want, privately, without Big Tech watching."

3.3 FOR THE COMMUNITY
---------------------
"Our stokvel communicates without banks profiling us."
"Our church group organizes without advertisers targeting us."
"Our small business operates without competitors data-mining us."

3.4 FOR SOCIETY
---------------
"Journalists can protect sources."
"Activists can organize safely."
"Democracy functions without algorithmic manipulation."
"African communities own their digital future."

================================================================================
4. THE DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

SLOW IS SMOOTH. SMOOTH IS FAST.

We do not rush. We do not cut corners on security. We do not ship broken.

- Every feature is specified before coded
- Every security claim is verified
- Every privacy promise is enforced technically, not just policy
- Every limitation is documented honestly

A fast release that compromises privacy is a failure.
A slow release that earns trust is success.

================================================================================
5. SUMMARY
================================================================================

Circle OS is:
- A privacy-respecting mobile operating system
- Built on Linux, compatible with Android apps
- Designed to run on existing devices (P30 Lite reference)
- Dual-boot friendly — coexists with Android
- Secure to GrapheneOS standards where hardware allows
- Honest about limitations where hardware constrains
- Accessible to ages 8-80, all abilities
- Open source, community governed

Circle OS is not:
- A Google replacement that acts like Google
- A walled garden with different walls
- Security theater — we prove our claims
- Vaporware — we ship what we specify

The individual is sovereign.
The community is chosen.
The technology is ours.

Welcome to Circle.
