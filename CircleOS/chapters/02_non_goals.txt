CIRCLE OS SPECIFICATION
Chapter 02: Non-Goals
================================================================================

Document: 02_non_goals.txt
Version: 1.0
Date: December 2025
Status: Foundation

================================================================================
PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
================================================================================

Knowing what we will NOT do is as important as knowing what we will.
This chapter defines explicit boundaries. These are not temporary limitations —
they are permanent design decisions.

If a feature request conflicts with a non-goal, the answer is NO.

================================================================================
1. NON-GOALS: PRIVACY & SECURITY
================================================================================

1.1 WE WILL NOT COMPROMISE PRIVACY FOR CONVENIENCE
--------------------------------------------------
- We will not pre-install apps that track users
- We will not enable analytics or telemetry by default
- We will not make privacy settings hard to find
- We will not use dark patterns to encourage data sharing
- We will not sell, share, or monetize user data — ever

If a feature cannot be built without compromising privacy, we do not build it.


1.2 WE WILL NOT COMPROMISE SECURITY FOR APP COMPATIBILITY
---------------------------------------------------------
- We will not disable sandboxing to make an app work
- We will not grant root access to apps that demand it
- We will not weaken encryption for "enterprise features"
- We will not backdoor our security for any government
- We will not create "trusted" app tiers with special privileges

If an app cannot function within our security model, that app does not run.
The user may choose a different app. We will not weaken the system.


1.3 WE WILL NOT PRETEND SECURITY WE CANNOT DELIVER
--------------------------------------------------
- We will not claim Tier 1 security on Tier 3 hardware
- We will not hide limitations in fine print
- We will not use "secure" as marketing without technical backing
- We will not imply protection we cannot enforce

Users deserve honest assessments of their security posture.


1.4 WE WILL NOT BECOME THE NEW SURVEILLOR
-----------------------------------------
- Circle Foundation will not track users
- Circle Store will not profile purchasing behavior
- Circle Services will not build advertising profiles
- We will not know more about users than absolutely necessary

The cure for surveillance capitalism is not different surveillance.
It is no surveillance.

================================================================================
2. NON-GOALS: COMPATIBILITY
================================================================================

2.1 WE WILL NOT SUPPORT EVERY DEVICE
------------------------------------
Some devices cannot be supported:
- Devices with no path to boot Circle OS (fully locked, no exploits)
- Devices with no available kernel sources
- Devices with hardware that cannot be driven without blobs we cannot sandbox
- Devices below minimum specifications

We maintain a clear compatibility list.
Devices not on the list are not supported. Community ports are welcome but
carry no guarantees.


2.2 WE WILL NOT GUARANTEE EVERY APP WORKS
-----------------------------------------
Some apps are fundamentally incompatible:
- Apps that require Google Play Services with root trust (SafetyNet/Play Integrity)
- Apps that refuse to run without invasive permissions
- Apps that detect and block modified OS environments
- Apps that require hardware attestation we cannot provide

We will document known incompatibilities.
We will provide workarounds where possible (sandboxed Play Services).
We will not break our security model to satisfy hostile apps.


2.3 WE WILL NOT MAINTAIN ANDROID FEATURE PARITY
-----------------------------------------------
Circle OS is not Android with a privacy skin.
Some Android features will not exist:
- Google Assistant integration (replaced with privacy-respecting alternatives)
- Seamless Google account sync (users manage accounts explicitly)
- Android Auto (unless it can function without Google Services)
- Features that exist solely to serve advertising

We build what serves users, not what serves Android's ecosystem.

================================================================================
3. NON-GOALS: HARDWARE
================================================================================

3.1 WE WILL NOT DESIGN FOR FLAGSHIP SPECS ONLY
----------------------------------------------
Circle OS must run well on:
- 4GB RAM (P30 Lite baseline)
- 64GB storage
- Mid-range processors
- 720p displays

We will not assume flagship hardware.
Features that require high-end specs must degrade gracefully.


3.2 WE WILL NOT REQUIRE CIRCLE HARDWARE
---------------------------------------
Circle native hardware is the best experience.
It is not the only experience.

Every feature must work on ported devices unless:
- It requires hardware that only Circle devices have (NearLink, module hot-swap)
- It requires security hardware not present (in which case, clearly documented)

Circle OS on a P30 Lite is still Circle OS.


3.3 WE WILL NOT LOCK HARDWARE CHOICES
-------------------------------------
Circle native hardware uses:
- Standard connectors (USB-C)
- Replaceable modules
- Open designs (CERN OHL)

We will not:
- Create proprietary accessories
- Lock features to Circle-brand peripherals
- Prevent third-party module manufacturing

Vendor lock-in is not a business model. It is a betrayal.

================================================================================
4. NON-GOALS: BUSINESS MODEL
================================================================================

4.1 WE WILL NOT BECOME DEPENDENT ON DATA MONETIZATION
-----------------------------------------------------
Revenue must come from:
- Hardware sales (Circle devices, accessories)
- Optional services (cloud storage, support contracts)
- Enterprise licensing (if applicable)
- Donations and grants

Revenue must never come from:
- Selling user data
- Advertising profiles
- "Anonymous" analytics that aren't
- Partnerships that require user surveillance


4.2 WE WILL NOT ACCEPT CONFLICTED FUNDING
-----------------------------------------
The Circle Foundation will not accept funding that:
- Requires compromises to privacy or security
- Gives any entity control over technical decisions
- Creates obligations that conflict with user interests
- Comes from entities whose business is surveillance

Funding transparency is mandatory. Conflicts of interest are disqualifying.


4.3 WE WILL NOT PURSUE GROWTH OVER PRINCIPLES
---------------------------------------------
We will not:
- Soften privacy to gain app developer support
- Weaken security to pass Google certification
- Add tracking to "improve user experience"
- Compromise principles to reach more users

A smaller user base with real privacy beats a larger user base with fake privacy.
We grow by earning trust, not by abandoning values.

================================================================================
5. NON-GOALS: SCOPE
================================================================================

5.1 WE WILL NOT BUILD A DESKTOP OS
----------------------------------
Circle OS is a mobile operating system.
Convergence (phone-as-desktop) is interesting but out of scope.
We focus on mobile excellence, not mediocre everything.


5.2 WE WILL NOT BUILD OUR OWN APP ECOSYSTEM FROM SCRATCH
--------------------------------------------------------
Android app compatibility is the strategy.
We do not need:
- A new app development framework
- A new programming language
- A new app paradigm

Developers build Android apps. Those apps run on Circle OS.
Circle-native apps (PWAs, system apps) follow standard patterns.


5.3 WE WILL NOT COMPETE WITH GRAPHENEOS ON PIXELS
-------------------------------------------------
GrapheneOS exists. It is excellent. It runs on Pixels.

If a user has a Pixel and wants maximum security, recommend GrapheneOS.
Circle OS differentiates through:
- Broader device support (P30 Lite, etc.)
- Dual boot coexistence (less commitment required)
- Age-adaptive modes (Kid, Elder)
- African market focus (offline-first, stokvel integration)
- Circle native hardware path

We complement GrapheneOS, not compete.

================================================================================
6. NON-GOALS: COMMUNITY
================================================================================

6.1 WE WILL NOT TOLERATE TOXIC CONTRIBUTION
-------------------------------------------
Open source does not mean open abuse.
Contributors must:
- Respect the code of conduct
- Accept design decisions (after discussion)
- Work constructively

We will not accept:
- Harassment of maintainers
- Demands without contribution
- Hostile forks designed to undermine (forks are fine; hostility isn't)


6.2 WE WILL NOT LET LOUD VOICES OVERRIDE PRINCIPLES
---------------------------------------------------
Feature requests are welcome.
Demands that violate non-goals are not.

"Many people want this" is not sufficient justification if "this" conflicts
with privacy, security, or accessibility requirements.

We listen. We do not capitulate.

================================================================================
7. SUMMARY: THE LINE WE WILL NOT CROSS
================================================================================

Circle OS will NEVER:
- Sell, share, or monetize user data
- Weaken security for compatibility
- Lie about our limitations
- Become what we set out to replace
- Abandon users who trusted us with their privacy

These are not negotiable.
These are not "for now."
These are permanent.

If Circle Foundation ever violates these non-goals, the community should fork
the code (it's open source) and continue without us.

That's not a threat. It's a promise. It's the accountability we accept.
